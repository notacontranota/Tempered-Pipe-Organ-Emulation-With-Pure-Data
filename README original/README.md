# Pipe-Organ-Emulation-With-Pure-Data

This is the project i developed for Digital Audio Processing exam when i was an University student.
Load "pipe_organ.pd" in Pure Data, connect a MIDI keyboard and enjoy playing!
If you want to understand a bit of theory behind the code have a look at file "presentation.pdf".
